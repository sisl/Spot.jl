# About

Spot.jl is a wrapper of the c++ library [Spot: a platform for LTL and Ï‰-automata manipulation](https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/).
It relies on Spot_julia_jll.jl, an artifact providing binaries for Spot for a variety of platforms. 
Spot.jl exposes only a limited subset of Spot's existing functionalities wrapped into julia functions for easier use.
